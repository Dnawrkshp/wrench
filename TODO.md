# Todo List

In no particular order:

- Build System/CI
	- Run CI on multiple platforms
	- Integrate automated testing
	- Automate releases
	- Clean up some other cmake stuff
- Moby Model Packing
	- Seperate out matrix allocation/scheduling from read/write functions to improve testability
	- Use the existing tristrip algorithm to build new submeshes
- Tfrag Model Packing
	- Recover original tfaces
		- Possibly compare different LOD levels to determine which strips are part of which tface
	- Figure out how tfaces should be represented in the source format
	- Build new tfrags
- Tie Model Packing
	- Similar issues as with the tfrag renderer
- Occlusion System
	- Possibly use OpenGL in wrenchbuild to speed things up (should be faster than raycasting)
- Gameplay Source Format
	- Will probably be based on the Wrench Text Format
	- System for editing/storing pvar data
- General Editor Improvements
	- Transform tool, etc
	- GUI for editing asset files
		- Should make use of the asset schema
- Audio Packing/Unpacking
	- VAG files
	- 989snd sound banks
		- Samples
		- IOP-side scripting with grains
		- Version used in R&C doesn't seem to support MIDI (good?)
- GUI/HUD System
	- Widget 3D file
	- HUD banks
- Asset system improvements
	- Incremental build support
	- Support for storing the asset graph to disk and only reparsing asset files that have been modified
		- All *Asset objects stored in a single buffer
		- Relative pointers
		- Don't worry about ABI issues, the files don't need to be portable
		- Security? Validate the input, or use a machine ID + checksum?
	- Multithreading?
- Sky Packing
	- Automatically split up a mesh into separate clusters
- Texture Packing
	- Automatic conversion to paletted colour
	- Merge palettes together (like the original game does)
- Memory Map
	- Determine memory map during build
		- Error out if the files are too big to work
- Collsion System
	- Recover instanced collision.
