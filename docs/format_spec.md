## Changelog

### Version 1

Initial release.

### Version 2

Changed "index" to "id" for instances. Changed the existing "id" from the help messages to "string_id" and the existing id for the tie ambient RGBA values to "number". You probably don't need to support version 1 as version 2 was released only a few hours after version 1.
