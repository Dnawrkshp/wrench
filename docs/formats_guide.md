## Purpose of this Document

This document is intended for people who want to contribute to the development of Wrench, or for whose who want to write their own tools to work with the Ratchet & Clank game's native file formats. It describes many of these formats in detail, however it is currently incomplete.

This document is not required reading for someone who just wants to use Wrench to inspect/edit levels.

## Background
## Levels

Levels are split into level files, audio files and scene files.

### Primary

This lump contains game code and assets.


### Sound Banks

The games use 989snd, an audio library for the PS2 from Sony.
