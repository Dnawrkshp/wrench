# C++ Parser

Wrench includes a special-purpose C++ parser which is used for reading data type definitions for pvars.

## Enablement

This parser can be turned on using the following line in a header file:

```
#pragma wrench parser on
```

And can be turned off with the following line:

```
#pragma wrench parser off
```

## Language Feature Support

All code between these two delimiters must conform to the limitations of the parser. The following language features are supported:

- C-style structs and unions.
- Enums (values must be specified as integer literals)
- Basic built-in types: `char`, `unsigned char`, `signed char`, `short`, `unsigned short`, `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, `long long`, `unsigned long long`, `float`, `double`, `bool` and `void`.
- Fixed width integer types: `s8`, `u8`, `s16`, `u16`, `s32`, `u32`, `s64`, `u64`, `u128`, `s128`.
- Pointers, references and C arrays.

A (probably incomplete) list of language features that are currently unsupported is provided below:

- Anything that isn't a type.
- Inline structs or unions (use named types instead).
- Most C++-specific features such as inheritance, member functions, templates, etc.
- Bit fields.
- Comma-separated lists of variables.
- Function pointers.

## Includes

The parser ignores include directives. Instead, it reads all the files in `src/game_common` and either `src/game_rac`, `src/game_gc`, `src/game_uya` or `src/game_dl` from all asset banks (if a type is defined in multiple asset banks the type from the asset bank mounted last is used).

## ABI

The pvar data stored in the instances file conforms to the PS2 ABI. The following sizes and alignments are used:

| Types                             | Size | Alignment |
| --------------------------------- | ---- | --------- |
| `char`, `unsigned char`           | 1    | 1         |
| `short`, `unsigned short`         | 2    | 2         |
| `int`, `unsigned int`             | 4    | 4         |
| `long`, `unsigned long`           | 8    | 8         |
| `long long`, `unsigned long long` | 8    | 8         |

To create a 128-bit field, use `s128` or `u128`.
